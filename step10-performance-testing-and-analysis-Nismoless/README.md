We have 5 differenet IRSystems, testinterface allows the user to use the interface, but we are also testing which of the irs systems is the fastest and so far the hash table was consistently the fastest. In randomfiles.py we generate random music track data and shuffle it before writing it to a final file, in analysis.py we compare the times between different search systems. 

A big thank you to my peers and class mates Fabian Villasenor and Robert Eusanio for their help this semester and a big thank you to Professor Hatem for making us into better programmers this semester.
